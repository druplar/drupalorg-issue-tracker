# Drupal Issue Tracker

A Chrome application to provide a simple method for keeping track of Drupal.org project issues.

## Functionality

Take a Drupal.org issue number (the node ID) and add it to the app. It will then utilize Drupal.org's REST APIs and keep
track of the issue. This allows you to keep a collection of important issues and periodically check their status.

## Why?
Managing patches when developing a product is a headache. It can be especially daunting if you're extending upon a suite
of modules (Panopoly, Open Atrium.) You're not only patching contribute projects, but then those other projects as well.

Reading a makefile doesn't exactly highlight all of your patches and their status. Also, if you're building a product, 
you're going to want to track important issues that will affect your development.
